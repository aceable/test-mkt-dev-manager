# MKT Code Sample

Aceable is getting into the flying robot pilot licensing market. As a marketing web developer, your job will be to create a landing page for our products and advise how you would document the task for future maintenance by your team. After you've finished this task, please answer the following questions as an engineering manager.

1. If this sample had to scale to 100 similar front-facing sites (70% code reuse), how would you recommend building it?
2. How many resources from your team would you need and how would you divide the work effort?
3. What are your top three concerns for delivering any long term project?
4. How do you guarantee your team delivers quality projects?

## Your Task

For this sample, we want you to:

*   Create a simple Vue app, either from scratch or using the index.html template.
*   Make a GET request to the products API endpoint at https://mkt-endpoint.now.sh/products
*   Sort the products in the response by lowest price to highest.
*   Iterate through each product and present the title, price **in US dollars**, and description of each.
*   Attach a Markdown file as `PROJECT.md`, answering the engineering manager questions above.

## How-To

To take this code sample, we need you to:

*   Download or fork this repo.
*   Complete the exercise locally.
*   Take the resulting code and create your own GitHub repo. 
*   Send the link back to your Aceable contact.
*   Your code should be easy to run by following instructions in your README.md.
