*   Sort the products in the response by lowest price to highest.
*   Iterate through each product and present the title, price **in US dollars**, and description of each.
*   Attach a Markdown file with documentation on how to maintain your project and any concerns for scaling to a full site.

## How-To

To take this code sample, we need you to:

*   Download this repo, **do not fork it**.
